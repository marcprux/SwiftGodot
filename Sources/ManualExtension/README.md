#  ManualExtension

This example extension shows how you can write custom registration code
for your extension, to do more complicated things.

For a simpler example, see SimpleExtension.

The code is contained in ManualExtension.swift, the package definition
is contained by ../Package.swift and you must copy the 
resulting binary (ManualExtension) into the bin directory 
of your Godot project and place the ManualExtension.gdextension file
in the Godot project root.
